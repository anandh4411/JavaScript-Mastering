 -- Java Script Mastering --

1. Development Environment
    * Download Vscode
    * Download NodeJs
    * NodeJs is a c++ program, which contains chrome's
    * V8 JavaScript Engine
    * So we can run js outside a browser using js

2. JavaScript in Browser
    * Inside html file, in the last of body tag,
    * we can use script tag and write js inside it
    * don't write js before body contents or inside head tag
    * that may cause a white page in browser
    * because browser will be busy loading js, before loading actual content

    * Inside a js file, write the js code
    * and link it using <script src="main.js"></script>

3. JavaScript in Node
    * inside a terminal,
    * type "node main.js"
    * the output will be shown in terminal

4. Variables
    * uses memory locations to store data
    * and assingns a name to the memory location
    * it has an address too. but not possible to remember always

    * # var
    * before ES6 version of js, we used "var" keyword
    * for declaring or initializing a varibale
    * # let
    * now we uses "let" keyword as a best practice
    * eg: let variableName; // declaration (value will be undefined)
    * eg: let firstName = 'Anandh'; // initialization
    * you can also use "" for strings, but common way in js is ''
    * variable names cannot start with a number (1name)
    * cannot containe space or hyphen, use camel notation 

    * # multiple variable declaration
    * let firstName, secondName;
    * but the modern concention is to use single line for each variable
    * let firstName;
      let secondName;

5. Constants
    * # const variableName;
    * we uses const when our application doesn't want to change the value
    * of a varibale, that may cause bugs
    * at that situation, we uses constants

6. Primitive Types (Value types)
    * # eg: string, number, boolean, undefined
    * let name = 'Anandh'; // String Literal
    * let age = 21; // number literal
    * let isApproved = true; // boolean literal
    * let firstName = undefined; (let firstName;) // undefined
    * (undefined is type, at the same time it is value too)
    * let selectedColor = null; // null (for clearing value of a variable)
    * # 'symbol' is an ES6 variable 

7. Dynamic Language
    * JavaScript is a dynamic language
    * in static languages, type of a variable cannot be changed once it is declared
    * but in dynamic, it's possible. We can change the type at runtime
    * # typeof variableName
    * returns the datatype of a variable
    * let firstName = null;
    * typeof firstName;
    * this returns "object"

8. Objects (Reference Type)
    * let objectName = {};
    * they are like actual objects in real world
    * eg:
        let name = 'Anandh';
        let age = 21;
    * here these two fields are related each other
    * so we can implement this as one single Person object
    * let person = {
        name: 'Anandh',
        age: 21
    };
    * key value pairs

    * # accessing properties of obejct
    * one way - person.name = 'Anand'; (dot notation)
    * another way - person['name'] = 'Anand'; (bracket notation)
    * person.name is the default choice
    * but when we don't know the property name, use bracket
    * eg: let selection = 'name';
          person[selection] = 'Anandh';
