 -- Java Script Mastering --

1. Development Environment
    * Download Vscode
    * Download NodeJs
    * NodeJs is a c++ program, which contains chrome's
    * V8 JavaScript Engine
    * So we can run js outside a browser using js

2. JavaScript in Browser
    * Inside html file, in the last of body tag,
    * we can use script tag and write js inside it
    * don't write js before body contents or inside head tag
    * that may cause a white page in browser
    * because browser will be busy loading js, before loading actual content

    * Inside a js file, write the js code
    * and link it using <script src="main.js"></script>

3. JavaScript in Node
    * inside a terminal,
    * type "node main.js"
    * the output will be shown in terminal
